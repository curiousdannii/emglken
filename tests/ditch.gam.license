ABOUT HIGH ENERGY SOFTWARE
--------------------------

High Energy Software formerly distributed TADS as a shareware system,
but is no longer in business.  Mike Roberts, the developer of TADS,
is now maintaining and distributing the system as freeware.  We have
made an effort to remove references from these files to High Energy
Software and its former telephone and other contact information,
since all of those numbers and addresses are no longer in service.
If we inadvertantly left any such references intact, please disregard
them, since they're oversights.
